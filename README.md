# ETL-Project

For this progect we will be taking data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/) and the US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/) websites. We will find both National and State records for population, employment, household income, and wages, using a combination of downloadable files and good ol' fashioned web scraping.
Specifically, we will compare BLS wage data against Census household income at both the National and the State (NC) levels, and compare BLS employment counts against Census population counts.
